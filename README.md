## Simulations
* [CropCraft](https://github.com/Romea/cropcraft) – CropCraft is a python script that generates 3D models of crop fields, specialized in real-time simulation of robotics applications.
* [Fields Ignition](https://github.com/azazdeaz/fields-ignition) – Random crop field generator for Ignition Gazebo.
* [AOC tomato farm](https://github.com/LCAS/aoc_tomato_farm) – This package is a tomato farm/glasshouse generator/simulator compatible with both Gazebo and Unity in ROS2 as part of the Agri-open Core (AOC) project.
* [Helios](https://github.com/PlantSimulationLab/Helios) – The Helios simulation system is a versatile modeling framework that handles tasks such as managing geometry and associated data structures through a C++ API.
* [FIRA Hackathon 2025](https://github.com/FiraHackathon/hackathon2025_ws) – A Gazebo simulation environment of a real farm consisting of crop row fields, barns and slopes.
* [Virtual Maize Field](https://github.com/FieldRobotEvent/virtual_maize_field) – This is a package to procedurally generate randomized fields with rows of plants for Gazebo.
* [CPR-Gazebo](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/cpr_gazebo) - This repository contains additional indoor and outdoor simulation environments for use with Clearpath's robot platforms.
